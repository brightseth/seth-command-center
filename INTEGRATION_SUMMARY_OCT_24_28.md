## HOW OCT 24-28 WORK FEEDS INTO LIVING DASHBOARD

### Abraham Wireframes (Oct 25) → Eden Marketing Domain

**Connection**:
- Wireframes visualize covenant concept for Abraham agent
- Eden marketing roadmap (Living Dashboard, Nov 3 task) includes Abraham as first agent in sequence
- Wireframes inform "autonomy" narrative in Studio Log threads (Oct 31 task)

**Files**:
- `/Users/seth/abraham-wireframes/index.html` → Reference for covenant mechanics
- Living Dashboard: "Outline Nov–Feb roadmap (Abraham→Solienne→Miyomi→Geppetto→Gigabrain)"

---

### NODE Revision (Oct 24-27) → Variant/NODE Domain

**Connection**:
- Phil feedback cycle complete, strategy revised Oct 27
- Living Dashboard tasks now execution-focused (not approval-seeking)
- Programming strawman (Nov 5 task) builds on revised strategy
- Tom & Caleb call (Oct 31 task) aligns sales with programming

**Files**:
- `/Users/seth/node-artist-relations/READ_ME_FIRST_OCT_27.md` → Entry point post-revision
- `/Users/seth/node-artist-relations/NODE_INITIALIZE_STRATEGY_REVISED_OCT_27.md` → Updated strategy
- Living Dashboard: "Draft NODE Feb–May programming strawman" (Nov 5)

**Status Evolution**:
- Oct 26: "Awaiting Phil review"
- Oct 27: Phil review complete, 6 files created
- Oct 28: Living Dashboard reflects execution phase

---

### Vibecodings Update (Oct 26) → Not in Living Dashboard

**Connection**:
- Portfolio current through Oct 26 (38 projects, 83 days)
- NOT in Living Dashboard (not critical for Oct 28 - Nov 15 sprint)
- Can deploy post-Paris Photo when bandwidth available

**Files**:
- `/Users/seth/vibecodings/index.html` → Updated, ready to deploy
- `/Users/seth/Desktop/vibecodings-scan-oct26.md` → Scan report

**Recommendation**: Deploy in Nov 11-15 window (post-Paris Photo recovery)

---

### Status Report (Oct 26) → Strategic Context for Living Dashboard

**Connection**:
- Oct 26 Status provides project-level strategic context
- Living Dashboard provides task-level execution detail
- Both systems complementary, not redundant

**Use Cases**:
- **Oct 26 Status**: Why projects exist, how they relate, long-term timelines
- **Living Dashboard**: What's due today, who needs what when, daily accountability

**Files**:
- `/Users/seth/CURRENT_STATUS_OCT_26_2025.md` → Strategic context (archive)
- `/Users/seth/LIVING_DASHBOARD_OCT_28_NOV_15.md` → Execution plan (active)

---

### Solienne Manifesto Handoff (Oct 27) → Excluded from Living Dashboard

**Connection**:
- Handoff complete, Henry building independently
- Seth monitoring only (no active tasks)
- Correctly EXCLUDED from Living Dashboard (not Seth's work Oct 28 - Nov 15)

**Timeline**:
- Oct 27: Handoff meeting
- Oct 28 - Nov 17: Henry independent build
- Nov 18: Soft launch (Days 1-7 private test)
- Nov 25: Public launch (Day 8)

**Files**:
- `/Users/seth/solienne-manifesto-hub/HENRY_HANDOFF_OCT_27.md` → Handoff documentation
- Living Dashboard: [Not present — correct exclusion]

---

### Solienne / Paris Photo — Physical Exhibition Logistics
- 10 granular tasks (LED, prints, book, video, performance)
- Vendor-specific deadlines (CosyPixel, Quintal, Magma, VTV)
- Kristi performance schedule coordination

**Why New**: Oct 24-28 tracked website development. Living Dashboard adds physical exhibition infrastructure.

---

### Glitch Residency — Full Task Breakdown
- 5 specific deliverables (presentation, workshops, clip, leads, recap)
- Oct 28-31 limited Seth availability

**Why New**: Oct 24-28 mentioned Glitch as scheduling constraint. Living Dashboard treats as full domain.

---

### Variant / Node — Sales Strategy
- Tom & Caleb call (Oct 31)
- Fidenza + Gondi decision framework

## CROSS-PROJECT CONNECTIONS

### Eden → NODE → Solienne (Narrative Coherence)
- **Eden**: Infrastructure for autonomous artists
- **NODE**: Exhibition programming for AI art
- **Solienne**: First AI artist debut at Paris Photo

**Living Dashboard Integration**:
- "Outline Nov–Feb roadmap" (Nov 3) connects Eden agent releases
- "Draft NODE programming strawman" (Nov 5) defines exhibition themes
- "Write Solienne → NODE bridge concept" (Nov 6) links exhibition to programming

**Guiding Principle**: **Autonomy · Ritual · Culture** — every project feeds one of these three

---

### Abraham Wireframes → Eden Marketing → Social Cadence
- **Abraham Wireframes** (Oct 25): Covenant UI/UX visualization
- **Eden Marketing** (Living Dashboard): Studio Log threads + IG carousels
- **Social Cadence** (Living Dashboard, Oct 31): Regular posting rhythm

**Connection**: Wireframes inform covenant narrative for marketing content

---

### NODE Revision → Programming Strawman → Artist Outreach
- **NODE Revision** (Oct 27): Strategy revised post-Phil feedback
- **Programming Strawman** (Living Dashboard, Nov 5): Feb-May 2026 themes
- **Artist Outreach** (Not in Living Dashboard): Post-Paris Photo (Nov 11+)

**Timeline**: Programming defined → Artists contacted → Shows booked

---

### Paris Photo Logistics → Exhibition Opening → Eden Relaunch
- **Paris Photo Logistics** (Living Dashboard, Oct 29 - Nov 4): Physical setup
- **Exhibition Opening** (Nov 10): First AI artist at blue-chip fair
- **Eden Relaunch** (Living Dashboard, Nov 15): Brand unified, social rhythm established

**Critical Path**: Paris Photo is anchor event, everything else flows around it

## SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK

### Documentation Quality: EXCELLENT
- Living Dashboard: 18-day execution plan with accountability
- Deduplication Report: Overlap analysis and gap identification
- Integration Summary: Historical continuity from Oct 24-28
- Oct 26 Status: Strategic context preserved

### Coordination Status: EXCELLENT

- New tasks identified (Paris Photo logistics, Glitch, Finance, Personal)
- Gaps addressed (website pages, Henry monitoring, Eden campaign Days 7-19)
- Cross-project connections explicit (Eden → NODE → Solienne)

### Timeline Risk: MODERATE
- Paris Photo (Nov 10): 10 tasks due Oct 29 - Nov 4, buffer Nov 5-8
- Glitch (Oct 28-31): Limited availability, other deadlines fall Oct 31
- Multiple hard deadlines: Oct 29 (Blue Card), Oct 31 (multiple), Nov 10 (Paris Photo)

### Execution Readiness: HIGH
- Clear priorities for next 48 hours
- Dependencies identified (print vendors, tech team, Kristi)
- Accountability structure in place (Living Dashboard task tracking)
- Recovery/buffer time built in (Nov 5-8, Nov 11-15)
