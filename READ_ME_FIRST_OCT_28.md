## GAPS IDENTIFIED (Needs Attention)

### 1. SOLIENNE.AI V2 Website Pages
**Gap**: Oct 26 tracked outstanding website pages (/consciousness, /paris-photo, /press). Living Dashboard focuses on physical exhibition only.

**Question**: Are website pages still required for Nov 10 launch?

**Recommendation**: If yes, add to Living Dashboard:
- Build /consciousness page (Nov 5-7)
- Build /paris-photo page (Nov 7-8)
- Build /press page (Nov 8-9)

### 2. Eden 30-Day Campaign (Days 7-19)
**Gap**: Living Dashboard has tasks through Nov 4. Eden campaign runs through Nov 22 (Day 30).

**Recommendation**: Add Week 2-3 content tasks:
- Week 2 content (Nov 4-11)
- Week 3 content (Nov 12-15)

### 3. NODE Artist Outreach
**Gap**: Oct 26 tracked Nov 8 artist outreach. Living Dashboard has programming strawman (Nov 5) but no outreach tasks.

**Recommendation**: Add post-Paris Photo:
- Begin artist conversations (Nov 11-15)

---
