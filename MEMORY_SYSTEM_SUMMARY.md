# TODO & Memory System - Executive Summary
## What You Asked For vs What You Already Have

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** 80% Complete - Ready for MVP Extensions

---

## The Big Picture

**You asked:** "Build a persistent TODO management system that maintains memory over days/weeks/months, ingests from multiple sources, synthesizes intelligently, and is accessible everywhere."

**Reality:** **You already built 80% of this system.** The Seth Command Center at `/seth-command-center` has:

- ✅ **Persistent TODO system** with PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (dev)
- ✅ **Multi-source ingestion** (email, API, manual, slash commands)
- ✅ **Smart ranking** (Top 3 algorithm with priority, energy, deadline scoring)
- ✅ **Multiple interfaces** (Web UI, API, ChatGPT export)
- ✅ **Complete history** (AuditLog tracks everything)
- ✅ **Background processing** (Job queue for async tasks)
- ✅ **Project categorization** (MIYOMI, SOLIENNE, Eden, Personal)
- ✅ **Energy levels** (Deep work, normal, light tasks)
- ✅ **Focus windows** (Automatically schedules your day)

---

## What's Missing (The 20%)

### 1. **New Ingestion Sources**
- ❌ Limitless pendant integration (MCP available, just needs connector)
- ❌ Granola meeting notes (need file watcher)
- ❌ Claude Code .md files (need file watcher)

### 2. **Synthesis Engine**
- ❌ Duplicate detection (multiple mentions of same task)
- ❌ Task linking (group related items)
- ❌ Priority boosting (mentioned 3x = high priority)
- ❌ Context extraction (why was this created?)

### 3. **Long-term Memory**
- ❌ Archival & summarization (weekly/monthly summaries)
- ❌ Context window management (keep last 30 days active)
- ❌ Searchable history (find tasks from months ago)

### 4. **Access Enhancements**
- ❌ @seth agent integration (read-only API for Eden agent)
- ❌ Enhanced ChatGPT export (include synthesis data)
- ❌ Public website integration (filtered view for sethgoldstein.com)

## Quick Reference: What You Can Do TODAY

### 1. View Your TODOs
```bash
# Open web interface
open http://localhost:3001/command-center/todos

# Export for ChatGPT
curl http://localhost:3001/api/export/chatgpt
```

### 2. Add TODO via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/todos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Review MIYOMI character designs",

## Questions Resolved

### From Your Original Request:

**Q: Where should master TODO list live?**
**A:** PostgreSQL database (production) / SQLite (dev). Already working.

**Q: How to maintain history/versions?**
**A:** New TaskHistory model will track all changes. AuditLog provides system-level history.

**Q: How to watch Claude Code .md files?**
**A:** Chokidar file watcher monitoring `~/projects/**/*.md`. Implementation ready.

**Q: How to connect to Limitless API/MCP?**
**A:** Use existing MCP connection. API endpoint created.

**Q: How to handle Granola imports?**
**A:** File watcher on `~/Documents/Granola/**/*.md`. Implementation ready.

**Q: How to avoid duplicates?**
**A:** Synthesis engine checks recent tasks, increments mentionCount for duplicates.

**Q: Should synthesis be scheduled or on-demand?**
**A:** Both. Schedule every 30min via job queue, plus manual trigger endpoint.

**Q: How to maintain context over weeks/months?**
**A:** TaskHistory for full audit trail, synthesis for linking, weekly summaries for compression.

**Q: How should Control Center connect to TODO data?**
**A:** Already connected via Prisma. Just needs UI updates to show new fields.

**Q: How to make accessible to Claude Desktop?**
**A:** Export API already exists at `/api/export/chatgpt`. Just needs synthesis data added.

**Q: How to expose to @seth agent?**
**A:** New read-only endpoints at `/api/agent/status` and `/api/agent/query`.

**Q: Privacy: should new tasks default to PRIVATE or INTERNAL?**
**A:** Recommend INTERNAL (accessible to @seth, not public). Add privacy tags.

- **Vercel hosting:** Free tier sufficient
- **PostgreSQL:** $20/month (Vercel Postgres Hobby)
- **Total:** ~$27.50/month

### What You Get
- Unlimited TODO storage
- Multi-source automatic ingestion
- Intelligent deduplication
- Complete history forever
- Accessible from anywhere
- Background processing
- Real-time monitoring

---

## Next Actions

### Option A: Start MVP Implementation
```bash
cd /Users/seth/seth-command-center

# Day 1: Database migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_memory_system

# Install dependencies
npm install chokidar @anthropic-ai/sdk

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p src/services/ingestion
mkdir -p src/services/synthesis
mkdir -p src/services/memory

# Follow IMPLEMENTATION_MVP.md step by step
```

### Option B: Review & Refine Architecture
- Review `ARCHITECTURE_TODO_MEMORY_SYSTEM.md`
- Identify any missing requirements
- Clarify priorities (which sources first?)
- Adjust timeline (faster or slower?)

### Option C: Test Existing System
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open TODO interface
open http://localhost:3001/command-center/todos

# Open monitor dashboard
open http://localhost:3001/monitor

# Test ChatGPT export
curl http://localhost:3001/api/export/chatgpt | pbcopy
# Then paste in ChatGPT: "Show me my TODO list"
```

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. **Build on Solid Foundation**
- You already have production-grade TODO system
- PostgreSQL + Prisma proven in production
- No need to rebuild core functionality

### 2. **Incremental Enhancement**
- Add one source at a time
- Test each integration independently
- Ship MVP fast, iterate quickly

### 3. **Separation of Concerns**
- Ingestion layer handles all sources
- Synthesis engine runs independently
- Access interfaces don't know about sources

### 4. **Observable & Debuggable**
- AuditLog captures everything
- Job queue shows processing
- Monitor dashboard visualizes health

### 5. **Privacy by Design**
- Privacy tags on tasks
- Filtered exports for public/agent
- Complete audit trail
