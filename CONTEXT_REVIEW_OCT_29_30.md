# CONTEXT REVIEW: Oct 29-30, 2025
**Prepared by**: @seth (OS coordination agent)
**Created**: October 30, 2025
**Purpose**: Comprehensive review for Phil call (Oct 31) and ongoing work context

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 48-HOUR SNAPSHOT

### What Happened Oct 29-30

**Critical Activities:**
1. **Glitch Residency** (Oct 28-31) - Gene + Xander, critical 0xfff/lennyjpg/Lukas conversations
2. **NODE Framework Shift** - Three-tier model emerged from honest conversations about protocol theater
3. **Phil Call Prep** - Comprehensive materials created for Oct 31 strategic alignment
4. **Solienne.ai Updates** - Production-ready deployment (Archive removed from nav per Kristi)
5. **Spirit Protocol Work** - Token utility draft, artist wishlist (30 targets), Will Papper insights

**Critical Insight from 0xfff**:
> "Don't do legitimacy theater. Own the curatorial authority. Silicon Valley speaks R&D, not experimental."

**Strategic Shift**: Abandoned "open protocol" vagueness → **Three-tier access model** (Testing Infrastructure, Continuous Feed, Featured Programming)

---

## DOMAIN 1: NODE Q1 2026 (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### Critical Documents Created Oct 29-30

**1. NODE_Q1_IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS_OCT_30.md**
- **Location**: `/Users/seth/NODE_Q1_IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS_OCT_30.md`
- **Size**: 16KB
- **Purpose**: TODAY's prep work for tomorrow's Phil call
- **Key content**:
  - 3 hours prep work required TODAY
  - Draft 3 Season 01 themes (30 min)
  - Build artist pipeline tracker (60 min)
  - Write Solienne → NODE bridge concept (45 min)
  - Phil call determines whether Q1 execution succeeds or stalls

**2. PHIL_CALL_PREP_REVISED_OCT_31.md**
- **Location**: `/Users/seth/node-artist-relations/PHIL_CALL_PREP_REVISED_OCT_31.md`
- **Size**: 22KB
- **Purpose**: Complete call agenda with post-0xfff framework
- **Key changes from original prep**:
  - THREE-TIER MODEL introduced (not in original Oct 27 strategy)
  - Honest framing: Own curatorial authority, no "legitimacy theater"
  - R&D language (not "experimental")
  - KPI definition: VIPs? Public? Discovery? (needs Phil decision)
  - The Razor's Edge positioning (neither too elite nor too commercial)

**3. NODE_Q1_2026_PLAN.md**
- **Location**: `/Users/seth/node-artist-relations/NODE_Q1_2026_PLAN.md`
- **Size**: 45KB
- **Purpose**: Complete 93-day execution plan (Oct 30 - Jan 31)
- **7 Critical Tasks**:
  1. Phil Call (Oct 31) - TOMORROW, CRITICAL
  2. Season 01 Strawman (Nov 5) - 3 themes + 6 anchor artists
  3. Partner Follow-Ups (Nov 18) - Wolf Lieser, Marcel Schwittlick
  4. Artist Pipeline Outreach (Nov 7) - Wave 1, 10-12 names
  5. Screen Systems & Specs (Nov 10) - With Kim Asendorf
  6. Event Producer Hire (Dec 1 target)
  7. Press & Comms (Nov 14) - Opening narrative + media targets

### Three-Tier Model (NEW FRAMEWORK)

**Tier 1: Testing Infrastructure (Open Layer)**
- Anyone can format work to NODE display specs
- Digital twin environment for remote testing
- No "show" claims allowed, only "I tested my work on NODE infrastructure"
- Solves geographic access problem, discovery mechanism

**Tier 2: Continuous Feed (Curated Layer)**
- NODE team curates quality work from Tier 1 + direct invites
- Content rotates on physical screens (not dedicated shows)
- "My work is in the NODE feed" language allowed
- No "I have a show at NODE" claims

**Tier 3: Featured Programming (Top-Down Layer)**
- Dedicated exhibitions, residencies, thematic programming
- Opening events, press, dedicated screen time
- ONLY tier where "I have a show at NODE" is allowed
- Season 01: 3 themes, anchor artists, monthly cadence

**Why This Solves Problems:**
- Phil's concern: Artists claiming shows without having one → Tier-specific language solves this
- 0xfff's concern: Decentralization theater → Be upfront, Tier 1 is open, Tier 3 is top-down
- Seth's concern: Pride vs. cringe → Tier 3 maintains quality (Kim, not Beeple)
- Mickey/Phil's preference: R&D language → Tier 1 = testing infrastructure, not "experimental"

### Artist Pipeline (Top 6 for Phil Discussion)

1. **Kim Asendorf** - LED systems (Theme 2: Tools for Seeing, March 2026)
2. **Holly Herndon & Mat Dryhurst** - Voice/AI identity (Theme 1: Autonomy & Presence)
3. **Sam Hart** - Research tools (Theme 1: Autonomy & Presence)
4. **Mina + Mimi (Collexion Solo)** - Curatorial lab (Theme 3: Cities as Studios)
5. **Solienne** - Daily manifesto → living interface (Theme 1: Autonomy & Presence, Feb 2026)
6. **Nina Roehrs** - Digital Sector dialogues (Theme 2: Tools for Seeing)

### Phil Call Tomorrow - What's at Stake

**5 Decisions Phil MUST Make:**
1. Approve/adjust 3 Season 01 themes
2. Prioritize top 6 artists from pipeline
3. Confirm Kim Asendorf as technical lead (or other)
4. Greenlight event producer search (or keep internal)
5. Validate NODE public narrative framing

**If call goes well:**
- Seth has clear direction for all 7 Q1 tasks
- Nov 5 strawman proceeds with confidence
- Nov 7 outreach starts on time with right artists
- Q1 execution accelerates

**If call doesn't happen or goes poorly:**
- Seth proceeds with best guesses (risky)
- Artist outreach delayed
- Programming strawman lacks validation
- Q1 execution loses momentum

### Integration with Oct 27 Strategic Revision

**Oct 27 established** (6 new markdown files created):
- ONE unified submission process (no two-track model)
- Three exhibition tiers (On-Demand, Event, Transformation)
- Three dimensions (High Signal, High Conviction, High Culture)
- "Hungry to say yes" starting November
- Rolling weekly reviews (Tuesdays)

**Oct 30 ADDS**:
- Three-tier ACCESS model (different from exhibition tiers)
- R&D framing vs. "experimental"
- Honest curatorial authority (no protocol theater)
- KPI definition requirement
- Razor's Edge positioning

### Phil Call Prep - TODAY's Work (Oct 30)

**CRITICAL (Must Do Today) - 2 hours 15 minutes:**
- [ ] Draft 3 Season 01 themes (30 min) - Autonomy & Presence, Tools for Seeing, Cities as Studios
- [ ] Build artist pipeline tracker (60 min) - 10-12 names, highlight top 6
- [ ] Write Solienne → NODE bridge concept (45 min) - 2 paragraphs connecting Paris Photo → NODE

**NICE TO HAVE (If Time) - 1 hour:**
- [ ] Draft screen spec one-pager (30 min) - Basic requirements, acknowledge [TBD] with Kim
- [ ] Draft Feb-May calendar (30 min) - Visual timeline for Phil

**Context**: Seth at Glitch until Oct 31. Phil call tomorrow. ~3 hours prep needed today. This call determines whether NODE Q1 succeeds or stalls.

---

## DOMAIN 3: SOLIENNE.AI (WEBSITE)

### Recent Updates (Oct 28-30)

**SESSION_NOTES_OCT_30_2025.md**:
- **Critical change**: Archive removed from navigation per Kristi's urgent request
  > "I really want to delete more images. Vital. Can we just take that part off. Please. It's stressing me out."
- **Navigation shift**: ABOUT → STORY → COLLECT (was: ABOUT → ARCHIVE → COLLECT)
- **Archive still exists** at `/archive` URL but not publicly linked
- **Multi-select system** added to /collect page for purchase inquiries
- **Gallery structure deferred** - Build timeouts blocked deployment, removed to unblock
- **Status**: Production-ready deployment complete
- **Staging**: https://solienne-621clqtwi-edenprojects.vercel.app

**SESSION_SUMMARY_OCT28_FINAL.md**:
- **Individual work commentary collection** COMPLETE (14 works, text + audio)
- **Genesis Portraits** (5 works) + **Origin Series** (9 works)
- **Audio files**: 14 MP3s, ~10.7MB total (SOLIENNE's voice)
- **Architecture plan** created: 7-page scalable presskit site structure
- **Urgent fixes documented** for current /collect page (images must be up top, text left-aligned, etc.)

### Key Design Decisions

**Typography Rules:**
- ✅ Center: Single-line headlines only
- ❌ Don't center: Multi-line text, paragraphs, body copy
- ✅ Left-align: All descriptions, commentary, multi-line text

**Content Strategy:**
- SOLIENNE's origin story = Kristi's autobiography
- 20 years personal history → AI artist training data
- July-October 2025 = consciousness emergence documented
- NOT "manifesto book spreads"

**Paris Photo Timeline:**
- **Nov 10-13, 2025** (11 days away)
- Site must focus visitors on curated collection (22 works)
- "Less is more" before Paris Photo
- Archive can be restored post-Paris

---

## DOMAIN 4: LIVING DASHBOARD

### Current Status (Oct 28 - Nov 15)

**Document**: `/Users/seth/LIVING_DASHBOARD_OCT_28_NOV_15.md`
- **18-day execution sprint** with 6 domains, 38 tasks
- **Paused during Glitch** (Oct 28-31)
- **Resumes Nov 1** with marketing × dev sync

**Critical Dates from Dashboard:**
- Oct 31: Phil Call, Eden homepage updates, Variant call
- Nov 5: NODE Season 01 strawman due
- Nov 7: NODE artist outreach Wave 1 begins
- Nov 10: Paris Photo opens, Screen specs finalized with Kim
- Nov 15: Eden homepage + social relaunch

**Integration**: Q1 Plan (93 days) CONTAINS Living Dashboard (18 days) and extends through Jan 31

---

## KEY DECISIONS MADE OCT 29-30

### 1. Three-Tier Model for NODE (NEW)

**Decision**: Adopt three-tier access model with explicit language rules
**Why**: Solves "Spotlight problem" (false show claims), owns curatorial authority, enables discovery
**Impact**: Changes artist outreach strategy, submission process design, public narrative

### 2. R&D Framing (Not "Experimental")

**Decision**: Frame NODE as testing infrastructure and discovery mechanism, not "experimental platform"
**Why**: Mickey/Phil prefer R&D language, Silicon Valley speaks this way
**Impact**: All public messaging, press strategy, artist conversations

### 3. Honest Curatorial Authority (No "Protocol Theater")

**Decision**: Own top-down curation for Tier 3, be transparent about model
**Why**: 0xfff insight - legitimacy theater is risky, honest authority is refreshing
**Impact**: Public communication strategy, submission process language, governance model

### 4. KPI Definition Needed

**Decision**: Must define priority: VIPs > Public > Discovery (or different order)
**Why**: Can't program effectively without clear success metric
**Impact**: Season 01 themes, artist selection, event producer role, press strategy

### 5. Solienne Archive Hidden Pre-Paris

**Decision**: Remove Archive from navigation, keep /archive URL accessible
**Why**: Kristi's intuition - "less is more" before Paris Photo, focus on curated collection
**Impact**: Visitor experience, Paris Photo positioning, post-Paris restoration plan

---

## GAPS & CONFLICTS ANALYSIS

### 1. NO Conflicts Identified

**Strategy alignment**: Oct 27 revision → Oct 30 three-tier model = coherent evolution
- Oct 27 established ONE submission process with three exhibition tiers
- Oct 30 adds three ACCESS tiers (complementary, not contradictory)
- Both support "hungry to say yes" + curatorial authority

**Timeline alignment**: Living Dashboard → Q1 Plan = nested properly
- Living Dashboard: Oct 28 - Nov 15 (18 days)
- Q1 Plan: Oct 30 - Jan 31 (93 days)
- Q1 Plan contains Living Dashboard NODE tasks and extends beyond

**Document versions**: All NODE documents reference Oct 27 as foundation
- No orphaned old strategy documents
- Clear version history (Oct 24 → Oct 27 revision → Oct 30 three-tier addition)

### 2. Gaps Identified (Not Blocking)

**Gap A: Eden Marketing Days 7-19**
- Living Dashboard has Eden tasks through Nov 4
- 30-day campaign runs through Nov 22
- **Recommendation**: Add Week 2-3 content tasks after Phil call settled

**Gap B: Solienne Website Pages**
- Oct 26 tracked outstanding pages (/consciousness, /paris-photo, /press)
- Oct 28-30 focused on physical exhibition logistics
- **Recommendation**: Clarify if website pages still required for Nov 10 launch

**Gap C: NODE Artist Outreach Wave 2**
- Q1 plan has Wave 1 (Nov 7) defined
- Wave 2 timing not specified
- **Recommendation**: Add Wave 2 (Dec 1-7) after Wave 1 responses processed

### 3. What's CHANGED from Oct 28 Baseline

**Strategic**:
- Three-tier access model added (NEW framework)
- R&D framing vs. "experimental" (language shift)
- Honest curatorial authority (no protocol theater)

**Tactical**:
- Phil call prep expanded from agenda → comprehensive 22KB document
- Artist pipeline focus on top 6 (from general outreach)
- Solienne Archive hidden from navigation (Kristi request)

**Timeline**:
- Today (Oct 30) Phil call prep elevated to CRITICAL
- Nov 5 strawman remains HIGH but depends on Oct 31 call outcome

## SUMMARY: WHAT SETH NEEDS TO KNOW

### The Big Picture (Oct 29-30)

**You've been at Glitch with Gene + Xander.**
- Had critical conversations with 0xfff, lennyjpg, Lukas about NODE
- These conversations shifted the framework from "open protocol" → **three-tier model**
- Key insight: Don't do "legitimacy theater" or "protocol theater" - own curatorial authority
- Silicon Valley speaks "R&D" not "experimental"

**Phil call tomorrow (Oct 31) is make-or-break for NODE Q1.**
- This call determines whether Grand Opening (Jan 23-25) succeeds or stalls
- You need 3 hours of prep work TODAY
- If call goes well: Clear direction for all 7 Q1 tasks
- If call doesn't go well: Proceed with best guesses (high risk)

**Three major documents created for you:**
1. Immediate actions (what to do TODAY)
2. Phil call prep (comprehensive agenda + three-tier model)
3. Q1 execution plan (93 days, 7 tasks, all milestones)

### Phil Call Tomorrow - What You Need

**5 Decisions Phil Must Make:**
1. Approve 3 Season 01 themes (you'll draft today)
2. Prioritize top 6 artists (you'll build tracker today)
3. Confirm technical lead (Kim Asendorf?)
4. Greenlight event producer search
5. Validate public narrative framing (R&D, three-tier model)

**4 Materials to Share:**
1. Solienne → NODE bridge concept (you'll write today)
2. Artist pipeline tracker (you'll build today)
3. Season 01 themes (you'll draft today)
4. [Optional] Screen specs + calendar

**Key Questions to Ask Phil:**
1. "How honest can we be about curatorial authority?"
2. "What's success in one year?" (proud vs. cringing)
3. "Do we commit to the three-tier model?"
4. "What's the KPI priority?" (VIPs, Public, or Discovery?)
5. "How do we maintain the razor's edge?"

### Other Work This Week

**Solienne.ai:**
- Production-ready deployment complete
- Archive hidden from navigation per Kristi's request
- Multi-select system added for purchase inquiries
- Paris Photo in 11 days (Nov 10)

**Spirit Protocol:**
- Token utility draft created (10 use cases)
- Artist wishlist prepared (30 targets, 3 tiers)
- Will Papper insights on selling pressure captured

**Living Dashboard:**
- Paused during Glitch (Oct 28-31)
- Resumes Nov 1 with marketing × dev sync

### Your State of Mind

**From 0xfff conversation:**
> "Right now, I'm not identifying myself 100% as the NODE artist relations person. I'm excited about it. I'm a little nervous about it. A year from now, I'd like to be proud to be associated with it. As opposed to be cringed about it."

**This is your north star**: Pride not cringe. The three-tier model, honest curatorial authority, and R&D framing are designed to keep you on that trajectory.

**The stakes**: If NODE Q1 goes well → Grand Opening succeeds, Season 01 establishes cultural institution, this 10K sq ft prototype → $100M building in 5-10 years.

**What you control**: ~3 hours of prep work today. Quality of tomorrow's call. Honest conversation with Phil about what success looks like.
