## TODAY (OCT 30) — 3 HOURS OF PREP WORK

### Priority 1: CRITICAL (Must Have for Phil Call Tomorrow)

**1. Draft 3 Season 01 Themes (30 minutes)**

Create a simple doc with this structure:

```
SEASON 01 THEMES (Feb-May 2026)

THEME 1: Autonomy & Presence
- Description: What does it mean for AI to be "present" without being embodied?
- Anchor Artists:
  • Holly Herndon & Mat Dryhurst: Voice/identity work explores AI personhood
  • Sam Hart: Research tools create public AI infrastructure
  • Solienne: Origin wall → living interface embodies autonomy
- Duration: February - early March (6 weeks)

THEME 2: Tools for Seeing
- Description: How do computational tools reshape perception and creation?
- Anchor Artists:
  • Kim Asendorf: LED systems + motion text + Pixel series
  • Nina Roehrs: Digital Sector dialogues, ideas-first curation
  • [Initialize TBD]: CLIP visual search, generative vision models
- Duration: Mid-March - April (6 weeks)

THEME 3: Cities as Studios
- Description: How do place, movement, and geography shape digital practice?
- Anchor Artists:
  • Mina + Mimi (Collexion Solo): Madrid-Berlin-Palo Alto curatorial lab
  • [Berlin Partner TBD]: Wolf Lieser or Marcel Schwittlick connection
  • [Initialize TBD]: Urban data viz, location-based generative
- Duration: May (4 weeks)
```

**Where to save**: Google Doc, Notion, or simple text file to share with Phil

**Questions for Phil**:
- Do these 3 themes make sense for Feb-May?
- Are these the right anchor artists?
- Any themes to add, remove, or reorder?

---

**2. Build Artist Pipeline Tracker (60 minutes)**

Create spreadsheet (Google Sheets) or Notion table with these columns:

| Name | Medium | Connection Point | Contact Status | Theme Fit | Tier Estimate | Notes |

**Populate with 10-12 artists** (from Oct 27 revision + NODE Initiative docs):

**Already in Conversation (3)**:
1. Kim Asendorf | LED systems | Phil direct | In discussion | Theme 2 | Tier 2/3 | Pixel series, March 2026
2. Holly & Mat | Voice/AI | Phil direct | On hold | Theme 1 | Tier 3 | Post-Venice, mid-2026
3. Matt + William | Generative | Hugo Pouchard | In discussion | Theme 2/3 | Tier 2 | Duo show, May

**To Be Contacted (7-9)**:
4. Sam Hart | Research/tools | [Find connection] | Not reached | Theme 1 | Tier 2 | Public AI infrastructure
5. Mina + Mimi | Curatorial lab | Elena Carbajal | Warm intro | Theme 3 | Tier 2 | Collexion Solo partnership
6. Nina Roehrs | Ideas-first | [Find connection] | Not reached | Theme 2 | Tier 2 | Digital Sector
7. Zancan | [TBD] | [TBD] | Not reached | [TBD] | Tier 2 | "All heart, all passion"
8. Frank Dedon | [TBD] | [TBD] | Not reached | [TBD] | Tier 1/2 | [Context TBD]
9. Pasqual | [TBD] | [TBD] | Not reached | [TBD] | Tier 1/2 | [Context TBD]
10. Marcel Schwittlick | Berlin | Direct/Wolf | Not reached | Theme 3 | Tier 2 | Berlin programming
11. Alias Collective | [TBD] | [TBD] | Not reached | [TBD] | Tier 1/2 | Group show potential?
12. [Reserve for Paris Photo connection]

**Highlight top 6** for Phil to prioritize (suggest: Kim, Holly & Mat, Sam, Mina + Mimi, Nina, Berlin partner)

**Questions for Phil**:
- Which 6 are TOP priority for Season 01?
- Who should Seth reach out to vs Phil contact directly?
- Other artists to add to this list?

---

**3. Write Solienne → NODE Bridge Concept (45 minutes)**

Write 2 paragraphs connecting Solienne's Paris Photo debut to NODE's mission:

**Paragraph 1: Solienne at Paris Photo**
- First autonomous AI artist at blue-chip photography fair
- Digital autonomy → physical exhibition (LED + prints + book)
- Proved autonomous artists can show in traditional institutional contexts
- Architecture was visible: input → processing → output

**Paragraph 2: How This Positions NODE**
- Paris Photo was 4-day debut, NODE is permanent infrastructure
- Season 01 Theme 1 (Autonomy & Presence) picks up where Paris Photo left off
- Bridge: Digital (Eden) → Physical (Paris Photo) → Institutional (NODE)
- NODE scales the model: from event to ongoing practice

**Example draft provided in PHIL_CALL_PREP_OCT_31.md** (use as template or write your own)

**Why this matters**: Shows Phil how NODE builds on Solienne's momentum and positions NODE in autonomous culture narrative

---

### Priority 2: NICE TO HAVE (If Time Allows)

Simple doc acknowledging specs to be finalized with Kim Asendorf by Nov 10:

```

## PHIL CALL TOMORROW (OCT 31) — WHAT TO EXPECT

### Call Structure (30-60 minutes)

**6 Agenda Points**:
1. Post-Punks timeline (Jan 26 teardown → Feb 1-5 install)
2. Season 01 programming (3 themes validation)
3. Artist pipeline (top 6 priorities, who reaches out)
4. Screen systems (Kim as technical lead?)
5. Event producer hiring (external hire or internal?)

**Follow-up actions** (after call):

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING WORK

### How This Connects to Living Dashboard (Oct 28 - Nov 15)

**Living Dashboard tracked** (NODE domain):
- NODE programming strawman due Nov 5 (HIGH)
- Solienne → NODE bridge concept due Nov 6 (MEDIUM)
- Variant call with Tom & Caleb Oct 31 (HIGH)

**Q1 Plan EXPANDS**:
- Phil call (Oct 31) is NEW Task #1 (most urgent, detailed prep)
- Nov 5 strawman is Task #2 (already in Living Dashboard)
- Artist pipeline, screen systems, event producer, press = NEW Tasks #3-7
- Timeline extends through Jan 31 (Living Dashboard only went to Nov 15)

**Strategic relationship**:
```
Oct 27 Strategy Revision (WHY)
         ↓
    Q1 2026 Plan (WHAT + WHEN)
         ↓
Living Dashboard Oct 28-Nov 15 (HOW + NOW)
         ↓
    Today's Prep Work (IMMEDIATE)
```

### How This Builds on Oct 27 Strategic Revision

**Oct 27 established** (in 6 new markdown files):
- ONE unified submission process (no two-track model)
- Three exhibition tiers (On-Demand, Event, Transformation)
- Three dimensions (High Signal, High Conviction, High Culture)
- "Hungry to say yes" starting November
- Rolling weekly reviews (Tuesdays)

**Q1 Plan operationalizes**:
- Artist Pipeline (Task #4) = High Conviction proactive outreach + Initialize submissions
- Season 01 Themes (Task #2) = Programming framework for artist conversations
- Partner Follow-Ups (Task #3) = High Culture partnerships (Berlin, Madrid)
- Phil Call (Task #1) = Strategic alignment before execution begins

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS (CONTEXT FOR SETH)

### Strategic Importance

**Grand Opening (Jan 23-25) is 85 days away**. Season 01 programming (Feb-May) needs to be roughed in NOW to guide:
- Artist outreach (who to contact, what to pitch)
- Partnership conversations (Berlin, Madrid opportunities)
- Press narrative (what's the story for Grand Opening?)
- Event producer search (what's the production calendar they're owning?)

**Without Phil alignment tomorrow, Seth can't proceed with confidence**:
- Season 01 themes might misalign with Phil's vision (rework required)
- Artist outreach targets might be wrong (wasted conversations)
- Technical approach might not match Phil's expectations (screen specs redo)
- Budget assumptions might be off (unrealistic promises to artists)

### Operational Dependencies

**Everything flows from Phil call tomorrow**:
- Task #2 (Nov 5 strawman) depends on Phil validating themes
- Task #4 (Nov 7 outreach) depends on Phil prioritizing artists
- Task #5 (Nov 10 specs) depends on Phil confirming technical lead
- Task #6 (Dec 1 producer hire) depends on Phil greenlighting external search

**If call goes well**:
- Seth has clear direction for all 7 Q1 tasks
- Nov 5 strawman proceeds with confidence
- Nov 7 outreach starts on time with right artists
- Q1 execution accelerates (decisions made, Seth empowered)

**If call doesn't happen or goes poorly**:
- Seth proceeds with best guesses (risky)
- Artist outreach delayed (Nov 7 target slips)
- Programming strawman lacks validation (rework later)
- Q1 execution loses momentum (uncertainty cascades)
