## Technical Implementation

### Database Operations
```bash
# Schema pushed to production PostgreSQL
npx prisma db push

# Ingestion executed against production
node scripts/ingest-oct20-tasks.js
```

### Priority Mapping
```javascript
high → 1
medium → 2
low → 3
```

### Status Mapping
```javascript
todo → "open"
scheduled → "open" (with due date set)
```

### Tag Handling
- Comma-separated format: "ParisPhoto, Riso, Magma"
- Searchable and filterable in UI
- Color-coded project badges in task cards

### Notes Preservation
- JSON objects converted to formatted strings
- Banking details, meeting links, addresses preserved
- Extractable for context in future sessions
