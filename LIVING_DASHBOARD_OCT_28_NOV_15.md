# LIVING DASHBOARD: Oct 28 - Nov 15, 2025

**Owner**: Seth Justin Goldstein
**Period**: October 28 - November 15, 2025 (18 days)
**Document Created**: October 28, 2025
**Guiding Principle**: **Autonomy · Ritual · Culture** — every project feeds one of these three

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This 18-day sprint is the critical execution window leading into Paris Photo 2025 (Nov 10) and beyond. Six major domains require simultaneous coordination:

**Critical Path Items**:
1. **Paris Photo logistics** (Nov 9-15): LED setup, print delivery, book production, Kristi performance schedule
2. **Eden marketing relaunch** (Oct 31 - Nov 15): Website updates, social cadence, dev/marketing sync
3. **Glitch Residency** (Oct 28-31): Presentation, workshops, collaboration documentation
4. **Variant/NODE sales strategy** (Oct 31): Tom & Caleb call, Fidenza + Gondi decisions
5. **Blue Card residency** (Oct 29): Expats coaching session, Columbia transcript submission
6. **Finance/Admin cleanup** (Oct 29-31): Receipt uploads, invoice requests, budget tracking

**Operational Reality**: Multiple hard deadlines converge in next 10 days. Paris Photo (Nov 10) is the anchor. All other work must flow around exhibition logistics, Glitch participation, and Eden brand unification.

**What's Different from Previous Tracking**: This dashboard supersedes the Oct 26 status report with granular task-level execution detail. Previous tracking was project-focused; this is deadline-focused with daily accountability.

## COORDINATION NOTES

### Dependencies

**Paris Photo → All Other Work**:
- Nov 10 is the anchor deadline
- All other work must flex around exhibition logistics
- LED setup, print delivery, book production are critical path
- Kristi schedule coordination must happen by Nov 2

**Glitch Residency → Limited Availability**:
- Oct 28-31 limited Seth availability
- Marketing × dev sync delayed to Nov 1 (post-Glitch)
- NODE programming strawman pushed to Nov 5 (post-Glitch)

**Eden Marketing → Dev Alignment**:
- Homepage updates depend on Xander/Gene sync (Nov 1)
- Roadmap outline depends on dev feature timeline
- Social cadence depends on agent release sequence

**NODE → Variant Sales**:
- Feb-May programming informs sales strategy
- Tom & Caleb call (Oct 31) may influence NODE artist targets
- Solienne → NODE bridge concept connects exhibition to programming

### Risk Mitigation

**Paris Photo Timeline Risk (HIGH)**:
- 10 tasks due Oct 29 - Nov 4 before install (Nov 9)
- Print vendor dependencies (Magma, Quintal, CosyPixel)
- LED technical requirements with VTV
- **Mitigation**: Daily check-ins on logistics, buffer built into Nov 5-8

**Glitch Availability Risk (MEDIUM)**:
- Limited Seth bandwidth Oct 28-31
- Other deadlines fall Oct 31 (Eden, Variant, Paris Photo)
- **Mitigation**: Glitch tasks front-loaded to Oct 29-30, other work scheduled Nov 1+

**Finance Cleanup Risk (LOW)**:
- Receipt/invoice tracking for Paris Photo vendors
- Budget tracking before major exhibition spend
- **Mitigation**: All finance tasks Oct 29-31, before Nov install costs
