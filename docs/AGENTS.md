## How to Invoke Agents

### Direct Invocation
Use the agent name followed by task description:
```
mobile-first-builder create a venue browser for PARISEYE
design-guardian review the typography in index.html
data-curator normalize the consciousness manifest
```

### Implicit Invocation
Agents automatically activate based on trigger keywords:
```
"Deploy PARISEYE to production" -> vercel-deployer
"Build a gallery interface" -> mobile-first-builder
"Organize project files" -> doc-organizer
```

### Coordination Requests
Ask @seth to coordinate multi-agent workflows:
```
@seth deploy SOLIENNE with full quality checks
@seth update portfolio with latest projects
@seth optimize PARISEYE for production
```

---

## Integration with Command Center

### Task Routing
The Command Center API routes tasks to appropriate agents based on:
- Explicit agent mentions
- Trigger keyword matching
- Project context
- Task complexity

### Context Management
All agents share global context through Command Center:
- Active project status
- Recent deployments
- Design system state
- Data manifest versions

### Status Monitoring
Command Center tracks agent activity:
- Active tasks per agent
- Handoff chains
- Success/failure rates
- Performance metrics

---

## Agent Status Levels

- **Active**: Fully operational, responds to triggers
- **Testing**: In development, manual invocation only
- **Archived**: Deprecated, kept for reference

Current Status (2025-10-11):
- All 8 agents: **Active**

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Specific Agents
Instead of generic requests, invoke the right agent:
- ‚ùå "Fix the design"
- ‚úÖ "design-guardian review typography and spacing"

### 2. Chain Workflows
For complex tasks, coordinate multiple agents:
- ‚ùå "Build and deploy PARISEYE"
- ‚úÖ "@seth coordinate full deployment of PARISEYE with quality checks"

### 3. Provide Context
Help agents understand the full picture:
- ‚ùå "Update the manifest"
- ‚úÖ "data-curator update SOLIENNE manifest with new CLIP embeddings"

### 4. Trust Specialization
Let agents focus on their expertise:
- mobile-first-builder handles implementation
- design-guardian ensures brand consistency
- code-reviewer checks quality
- vercel-deployer manages production

### 5. Request Coordination
For cross-cutting concerns, ask @seth:
- Architecture decisions
- Multi-project updates
- Strategy and roadmaps
- Priority conflicts

cd /Users/seth/seth-command-center
npm run suggest-agent "build a gallery for my images"
# Suggests: mobile-first-builder, data-curator
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding
1. Check agent status in `agents.yaml`
2. Verify trigger keywords match task description
3. Try explicit agent invocation
4. Ask @seth to delegate manually

### Wrong Agent Activated
1. Use explicit agent name in request
2. Update trigger keywords in `agents.yaml`
3. Report to @seth for coordination pattern update

### Handoff Failure
1. Check Command Center logs
2. Verify previous agent completed task
3. Manually invoke next agent in chain
4. Report to @seth for workflow debugging

---
