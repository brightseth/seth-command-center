# Dashboard Deduplication Report — Oct 28, 2025

**Purpose**: Reconcile new Living Dashboard JSON with existing tracking systems
**Created**: October 28, 2025
**Agent**: @seth (OS coordination agent)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The new Living Dashboard JSON (Oct 28 - Nov 15) represents a **shift from project-focused tracking to deadline-focused execution**. This report identifies overlaps, clarifies what's new, and recommends how to use both systems together.

**Key Insight**: The Oct 26 Status Report is **strategic context**. The Living Dashboard is **operational execution**. Both are valuable, but serve different purposes.

---

## OVERLAP ANALYSIS

### 1. EDEN MARKETING

**Oct 26 Status Report**:
- "Gene Kogan call (30 min) - Abraham calendar, cross-promotion opportunities"
- Status: BLOCKING, Day 5 of 30-day campaign
- Next: Draft Twitter thread, begin Week 1 content calendar

**Living Dashboard (Oct 28)**:
- "Run marketing × dev sync with Xander & Gene" (Nov 1)
- "Apply 3 Claude-prompt actions to eden.art" (Oct 31)
- "Publish 1 Studio Log thread + 1 IG carousel" (Oct 31)
- "Outline Nov–Feb roadmap" (Nov 3)

**Analysis**:
- Gene call evolved into broader "marketing × dev sync" with Xander included
- Scope expanded from just Abraham calendar to full brand/roadmap alignment
- Specific content actions now explicit (Studio Log, IG carousel, homepage actions)
- Timeline: Nov 1 sync replaces "ASAP" urgency from Oct 26

**Recommendation**: Living Dashboard supersedes for execution. Oct 26 context explains why these tasks exist.

---

### 2. NODE ARTIST RELATIONS

**Oct 26 Status Report**:
- "Phil Mohun review of NODE Initialize strategy" (HIGH priority)
- Status: Awaiting Phil feedback, Nov 8 artist outreach target
- Files: `NODE_INITIALIZE_STRATEGY_FINAL.md`, `PHIL_BRIEF_FEB_MAY_2026.md`

**Living Dashboard (Oct 28)**:
- "Draft NODE Feb–May programming strawman (3 themes + anchor artists)" (Nov 5)
- "15-min call with Tom & Caleb → decide Fidenza + Gondi strategy" (Oct 31)
- "Write 2-paragraph Solienne → NODE bridge concept" (Nov 6)

**What Happened Between Oct 26 and Oct 28**:
- Oct 27: Phil review happened, major strategy revision completed
- 6 new markdown files created (READ_ME_FIRST_OCT_27.md, STRATEGIC_REVISION_SUMMARY_OCT_27.md, etc.)
- Strategy shifted from "awaiting approval" to "post-approval execution"

**Analysis**:
- Phil review COMPLETE, strategy revised
- Focus shifted from artist outreach (Nov 8) to programming definition (Nov 5)
- New sales coordination layer added (Tom & Caleb call)
- Solienne → NODE bridge concept connects exhibition to programming

**Recommendation**: Living Dashboard reflects post-Phil reality. Oct 26 status is historical context for why strategy was revised.

---

### 3. PARIS PHOTO / SOLIENNE.AI V2

**Oct 26 Status Report**:
- "Complete SOLIENNE.AI V2 for Paris Photo" (CRITICAL, Nov 10)
- Outstanding pages: consciousness, paris-photo, press
- Guided browser complete
- 15 days to deadline

**Living Dashboard (Oct 28)**:
- 10 granular logistics tasks (LED, prints, book, video, performance)
- Dates: Oct 29 - Nov 4 (before Nov 9 install)
- Focus: Physical exhibition infrastructure, not website

**Analysis**:
- Oct 26 tracked website development (digital)
- Living Dashboard tracks exhibition logistics (physical)
- Website pages NOT in Living Dashboard (still outstanding, but different workstream)
- Physical exhibition has specific vendor dependencies (Magma, Quintal, CosyPixel, VTV)

**Gap Identified**: Website development tasks from Oct 26 not explicitly in Living Dashboard

**Recommendation**:
- Living Dashboard for physical exhibition (critical path to Nov 10)
- Oct 26 status for website development (parallel workstream)
- Need to explicitly track website pages separately OR add to Living Dashboard

---

### 4. SOLIENNE MANIFESTO (Henry Handoff)

**Oct 26 Status Report**:
- "Henry Handoff Meeting (Solienne Manifesto)" (SCHEDULED OCT 27)
- 5 pre-work tasks (API keys, Vercel setup, Spirit Protocol)
- 90-minute meeting
- Timeline: Oct 28 build start → Nov 18 soft launch

**Living Dashboard (Oct 28)**:
- [NOT PRESENT]

**What Happened**:
- Oct 27: Henry handoff meeting completed
- Henry now building independently (Oct 28 - Nov 17)
- Seth monitoring only, not active execution

**Analysis**:
- Handoff complete, no longer Seth's active task
- Henry owns build until Nov 18 soft launch
- Correct to EXCLUDE from Living Dashboard (Seth not executing)

**Recommendation**: Oct 26 status remains authoritative for Solienne Manifesto timeline. Living Dashboard correctly excludes (not Seth's work).

---

### 5. VIBECODINGS PORTFOLIO

**Oct 26 Status Report**:
- "Deploy Vibecodings Portfolio" (HIGH priority)
- File updated Oct 26 (38 projects, 83 days)
- Command: `cd /Users/seth/vibecodings && vercel --prod`
- Duration: 5 minutes

**Living Dashboard (Oct 28)**:
- [NOT PRESENT]

**Analysis**:
- Vibecodings deploy NOT critical for Oct 28 - Nov 15 sprint
- Paris Photo, Eden marketing, NODE programming take precedence
- Portfolio can deploy anytime (no deadline pressure)

**Recommendation**: Keep in backlog, not critical path. Deploy when bandwidth available (post-Paris Photo).

---

## WHAT'S NEW (Not in Oct 26 Status)

### Domain: Solienne / Paris Photo — Physical Logistics

**NEW TASKS (10 items)**:
1. LED cabling/power with VTV (Oct 29)
2. CosyPixel (9×80×80) delivery (Oct 30)
3. Quintal (156 prints) delivery (Oct 30)
4. Manifesto Book cover approval (Oct 30)
5. Manifesto Book print run finalization (Oct 31)
6. Press/collector brief editing (Oct 31)
7. Solienne video loop creation (Nov 1)
8. Kristi performance schedule (Nov 2)
9. Paris Photo status sheet update (Nov 3)
10. Manifesto Book proof approval (Nov 4)

**Why New**: Oct 26 tracked website development. Living Dashboard tracks physical exhibition logistics with vendor-specific deadlines.

---

### Domain: Glitch Residency — Full Task Breakdown

**NEW TASKS (5 items)**:
1. 11 AM presentation (Oct 29)
2. 1-min social clip recording (Oct 29)
3. Workshop participation Wed/Thu (Oct 30)
4. Document 3 collaboration leads (Oct 31)
5. Glitch recap writeup (Nov 2)

**Why New**: Oct 26 mentioned Glitch as scheduling constraint ("Seth begins limited availability"). Living Dashboard treats it as full domain with deliverables.

---

### Domain: Variant / Node — Sales Strategy

**NEW TASKS (2 items)**:
1. Tom & Caleb call (Oct 31) - Fidenza + Gondi strategy
2. Follow-up after buyer meetings (Oct 31)

**Why New**: Sales coordination not in Oct 26 status. Connects NODE programming to Variant Gallery partnership.

---

### Domain: Finance / Admin — Vendor-Specific Cleanup

**NEW TASKS (4 items)**:
1. Mercury receipts upload (Tarron & Constance) (Oct 29)
2. Invoice requests (Lucy Logistics, D'mage) (Oct 29)
3. Magma/Quintal quote confirmations (Oct 30)
4. Budget tracker update (Oct 31)

**Why New**: Oct 26 had no finance/admin tracking. Living Dashboard makes pre-Paris Photo financial cleanup explicit.

---

### Domain: Residency / Personal — ENTIRELY NEW

**NEW TASKS (5 items)**:
1. Blue Card Expats session (Oct 29, 10:30 CET)
2. Columbia transcript order (Oct 29)
3. Haircut (Oct 31)
4. Massage / recovery (Nov 2)
5. Testosterone refill + labs (Nov 10)

**Why New**: Oct 26 status tracked only professional projects. Living Dashboard acknowledges Seth's full operational reality (health, residency, personal maintenance).

---

## WHAT'S STABLE (Same in Both)

### SOLIENNE.AI V2 Website
- URL: https://solienne-9260xycxr-edenprojects.vercel.app (password: "palais")
- Status: Password-protected preview live
- Outstanding: /consciousness, /paris-photo, /press pages

### Eden 30-Day Marketing Campaign
- Timeline: Oct 22 - Nov 22, 2025
- Current: Day 6 of 30 (was Day 5 on Oct 26)
- Infrastructure: Abraham banner, discovery flow, UTM tracking all live

### Paris Photo Hard Deadline
- Date: November 10, 2025
- Status: Exhibition opening, public commitment

### Production URLs (All Still Live)
- Eden Marketing: https://spirit-narrative-q7n4iidhz-edenprojects.vercel.app
- NODE CRM: https://node-artist-relations-c8r4noz0u-edenprojects.vercel.app
- PARISEYE: https://edenparis.vercel.app

---

## WHAT'S DROPPED (No Longer Tracked)

### Vibecodings Portfolio Deployment
- **Oct 26 Status**: HIGH priority
- **Living Dashboard**: Not present
- **Reason**: Not critical for Oct 28 - Nov 15 sprint

### Eden Marketing Week 1 Content Draft
- **Oct 26 Status**: "Draft first Twitter thread"
- **Living Dashboard**: Absorbed into "Studio Log thread + IG carousel"
- **Reason**: More specific content format defined

### Artist Outreach (Nov 8 Target)
- **Oct 26 Status**: "Begin artist outreach" post-Phil review
- **Living Dashboard**: Not present
- **Reason**: Phil review led to strategy revision; programming definition now precedes outreach

---

## GAPS & MISSING PIECES

### 1. SOLIENNE.AI V2 Website Pages

**Gap**: Oct 26 tracked outstanding website pages (/consciousness, /paris-photo, /press). Living Dashboard focuses on physical exhibition logistics only.

**Impact**: Website development not explicitly scheduled Oct 28 - Nov 15.

**Question**: Are website pages still required for Nov 10 launch, or is physical exhibition the priority?

**Recommendation**: If website pages still needed, add tasks to Living Dashboard:
- Build /consciousness page (Nov 5-7)
- Build /paris-photo page (Nov 7-8)
- Build /press page (Nov 8-9)

---

### 2. Solienne Manifesto Monitoring

**Gap**: Oct 26 tracked Henry's independent build (Oct 28 - Nov 17). Living Dashboard has no monitoring tasks.

**Impact**: No explicit check-ins with Henry before Nov 18 soft launch.

**Question**: Should Seth have periodic Henry check-ins (e.g., Nov 7, Nov 14)?

**Recommendation**: Add optional monitoring task:
- "Henry Week 2 check-in" (Nov 7) - LOW priority

---

### 3. Eden 30-Day Campaign Execution (Days 7-19)

**Gap**: Living Dashboard has tasks through Nov 4 (Gigabrain ingestion). Eden campaign runs through Nov 22 (Day 30).

**Impact**: No explicit execution plan for Days 7-19 (Nov 5 - Nov 15).

**Question**: What content/outreach happens during Paris Photo week and post-opening?

**Recommendation**: Add Eden campaign Week 2-3 tasks:
- Week 2 content (Nov 4-11)
- Week 3 content (Nov 12-15)

---

### 4. NODE Artist Outreach Post-Programming

**Gap**: Oct 26 tracked Nov 8 artist outreach start. Living Dashboard has programming strawman (Nov 5) but no outreach tasks.

**Impact**: Programming defined, but no execution path to artist conversations.

**Question**: Does outreach wait until after Paris Photo (Nov 11+)?

**Recommendation**: Add NODE outreach post-Paris Photo:
- "Begin artist conversations (10 targets)" (Nov 11-15)

---

## SYSTEM INTEGRATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Use Oct 26 Status Report For:
- **Strategic context**: Why projects exist, what problems they solve
- **Historical tracking**: What happened Oct 24-26
- **Long-term timelines**: Nov-Dec-Feb milestones
- **Project relationships**: How Eden, NODE, Solienne, Vibecodings connect
- **Architecture details**: Files, URLs, git activity, documentation index

### Use Living Dashboard (Oct 28 - Nov 15) For:
- **Daily execution**: What's due today/tomorrow
- **Priority decisions**: What matters most this week
- **Dependency tracking**: What blocks what
- **Vendor coordination**: Who needs what when
- **Accountability**: Task-level status updates

### Create New Documents For:
- **Session notes**: Add to existing SESSION_NOTES.md files per project

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Seth (Immediate)

1. **Today (Oct 28)**: Review Living Dashboard, confirm Oct 29 schedule
2. **Oct 29 morning**: Execute Blue Card + Glitch + Finance tasks
3. **Oct 30-31**: Paris Photo logistics + Eden marketing + Variant call
4. **Nov 1-4**: Content production (video loop, press brief, Kristi schedule)
5. **Nov 5-8**: Buffer for delays, NODE programming, Eden roadmap
6. **Nov 9-10**: Paris Photo install + opening

### For Future Sessions

1. **Mark tasks complete** in Living Dashboard as they finish
2. **Update SESSION_NOTES.md** for each project with outcomes
3. **Flag dependencies** if tasks blocked or delayed
4. **Generate next dashboard** Nov 11-15 (post-Paris Photo)

### For System Health

1. **Oct 26 Status Report** → Rename to `STATUS_ARCHIVE_OCT_26.md` (historical)
2. **Living Dashboard** → Keep as `LIVING_DASHBOARD_OCT_28_NOV_15.md` (active)
3. **This Report** → Keep as `DASHBOARD_DEDUPLICATION_REPORT_OCT_28.md` (reference)

---

**Document Location**: `/Users/seth/DASHBOARD_DEDUPLICATION_REPORT_OCT_28.md`
**Created**: October 28, 2025
**Agent**: @seth (OS coordination agent)
**Purpose**: Reconcile new Living Dashboard with existing tracking systems
**Status**: COMPLETE — Reference for system integration

---

**Verdict**: Living Dashboard supersedes Oct 26 Status for execution. Oct 26 Status remains valuable for strategic context. Both systems serve different, complementary purposes.
